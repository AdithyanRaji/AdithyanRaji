- ⚡ Fun fact: the first computer “bug” was quite literally a bug.In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper and her team found a moth stuck in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer, causing a malfunction. They documented it in their logbook as the “first actual case of bug being found,” and taped the moth to the page. Since then, the term debugging has become a core part of programming.
